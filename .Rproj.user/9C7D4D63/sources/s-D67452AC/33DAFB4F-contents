### Description

This report will examine the frequencies and proportions of gun deaths in 2012 and 2019 by intent, sex, and race. First I will provide analysis of the 2012 frequency counts, proportions and bar plots of gun deaths by intent, sex, and race. Then, I will outline analyses of the 2019 frequency counts, proportions and bar plots of gun deaths by intent, sex, and race. I will conclude this report with comparing percent of gun deaths between 2012 and 2019 by intent, sex, and race. 

*Source of data: The "Gun Deaths in America" data from the CDC's Multiple Cause of Death Database,* 
*which is derived from death certificates from all 50 states and the District of Columbia and is widely considered the most comprehensive estimate of firearm deaths.*

### Analysis of gun deaths in 2012

In this data set, gun death intent is divided into four categories: suicide, homicide, accidental, and undetermined. 
Race is dived into five categories: White, Black, Hispanic, Native American/Native Alaskan, Asian/Pacific Islander
Gender is categorized as either male or female. 

***
Figure 1 shows the proportion of gun deaths in 2012 by intent. According to the table, gun deaths by suicide were the highest proportion, followed by homicide. Accidental and undetermined gun deaths made up between 2-3 % of gun deaths in 2012.

### Analyses comparing gun deaths between 2012 and 2019

***
Figure 7 shows that the proportions of gun deaths by intent were mostly similar between 2012 and 2019, with suicide being the highest intent, and homicide following.

*Figure 7. Comparing intent behind gun deaths between years 2012 and 2019.* 
```{r echo=FALSE}
intent_12_19 <- cbind(intent.counts_12, intent.counts_19)

intent_12_19_percent <- 100*prop.table(intent_12_19, 2)

barplot(intent_12_19_percent,
        xlab = "Year",
        ylab = "Percents",
        legend = c("Accidental", "Homicide", "Suicide", "Undetermined"),
        args.legend = list(title = "Intent", cex = .7))

cbind(intent_12_19, intent_12_19_percent)
```

***
Figure 8 shows that proportions of gun deaths between males and females were very similar between 2012 and 2019, with males making up the majority of gun deaths in both years than females. 

*Figure 8. Comparing gun deaths by sex between years 2012 and 2019.* 
```{r echo=FALSE}
sex_12_19 <- cbind(sex.counts_12, sex.counts_19)

sex_12_19_percent <- 100*prop.table(sex_12_19, 2)

barplot(sex_12_19_percent,
        xlab = "Year",
        ylab = "Percents",
        legend = c("Female", "Male"),
        args.legend = list(title = "Sex", cex = .7))

cbind(sex_12_19, sex_12_19_percent)
```

***
According to figure 9, the the proportions of gun deaths between 2012 and 2019 were similar across racial groups. In both years, White individuals made up the majority of gun deaths, followed by Black individuals, then Hispanic individuals, Asian/Pacific Islander individuals, and Native individuals. 

*Figure 9. Comparing gun deaths by race between years 2012 and 2019.* 
```{r echo=FALSE}
race_12_19 <- cbind(race.counts_12, race.counts_19)

race_12_19_percent <- 100*prop.table(race_12_19, 2)

barplot(race_12_19_percent,
        xlab = "Year",
        ylab = "Percents",
        legend = c("Asian/Pacific Islander", "Black", "Hispanic", "Native", "White"),
        args.legend = list(title = "Race", cex = .7))

cbind(race_12_19, race_12_19_percent)
```

### Conclusions

I examined the frequencies and proportions of gun deaths in 2012 and 2019 based on intent of death, sex, and race. Ultimately, the trends in the data were similar between 2012 and 2019. Regarding intent, suicides comprised the highest number of gun deaths across both years, with homicides being the the second most cause of gun deaths, cumulatively comprising over 90% of gun deaths across both years. Gun deaths were also comparable across gender and race. Males had higher rates of gun deaths than females across both years. Additionally, across both years, the proportions of White individuals who died from gun deaths was the highest among any other racial group, with Black individuals being the second highest proportion. Overall, the consistency in trends in the data across both years indicate some common trends of the intent behind gun deaths in America, as well as who dies more as a result of gun deaths.
